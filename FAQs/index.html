						I will be working on adding new and improved content as time goes
						on. At present it is a basic website with insights into my
						experiences where i have been training for 5 years. Through the
						progress and injuries I have learnt a lot and will be adding a
						separate area for this info where people will be able to add their
						own also. I will be adding things like recipes which I know I
						struggled with for years as I was not eating the right foods which
						in turn reduced the gains I was making

					How can i reduce fatigue and increase my energy during workouts?

				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						To reduce fatigue and boost energy, ensure you're getting adequate
						sleep, staying hydrated, and fueling your body with nutritious
						foods. Consider incorporating a balanced mix of carbohydrates,
						proteins, and healthy fats into your diet. Also, start with moderate
						exercise and gradually increase intensity to build stamina.

					What's the best way to increase muscle gains?
				</button>
				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						For muscle gains, focus on strength training exercises that target
						major muscle groups. Increase the weight or resistance gradually as
						you become stronger. Ensure you're consuming enough protein to
						support muscle repair and growth. Rest days are crucial for muscle
						recovery, so include them in your routine.

				<div class="panel">
					<p>
						Ideally, aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity
						or 75 minutes of vigorous activity spread throughout the week, plus
						muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week. Adjust
						your workout frequency and intensity based on your fitness goals and
						recovery.

						meals and snacks to fuel your workouts and aid recovery, such as a
						protein-rich snack after exercise.
